In FabLab Zeeland kun je met behulp van moderne computergestuurde \u2018maakmachines\u2019 zoals 3D-printers, lasersnijder, vinylsnijder en ontwerpsoftware zelf dingen (leren) maken die voorheen alleen door megaconcerns konden worden gerealiseerd. \r\n\r\nDeze informele leer- werkplaats biedt iedereen de kans en ruimte om samen op lokaal, nationaal en internationaal niveau aan nieuwe idee\u00ebn, experimenten en uitvindingen te werken. Opgedane kennis en vaardigheden worden gedeeld met iedereen. Zo wordt de afstand van \u201cidee naar product\u201d kleiner. Loop je al een tijd met een idee rond maar je weet niet hoe je deze kunt vormgeven? Dan ben je in FabLab Zeeland aan het juiste adres.\r\n\r\nDe werkwijze is gebaseerd op het FabLab concept, zoals dat bedacht is door Neil Gershenfeld, directeur van het Centre of Bits and ATOMs (CBA) aan het Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Wereldwijd zijn er meer dan 360 FabLabs operationeel die via een uniek internationaal netwerk met elkaar zijn verbonden. In Nederland zijn er ruim 38 FabLabs. \r\n\r\nKijk voor meer informatie over fablabs op de website van stichting FabLab Benelux: www.fablab.nl\r\n\r\nWaar vind je ons?\r\nFabLab Zeeland is gevestigd in ons gebouw aan de Kousteensedijk in Middelburg. Naast het exploiteren van een vast lab binnen de muren van de ZB wordt, in samenwerking met Frysklab (het mobiele FabLab van Friesland), de onderwijsbus Columbus ingericht met een tweetal 3D printers. De mediacoaches van de Columbus brengen het \u2018maakonderwijs\u2019 onder de aandacht bij een aantal pilotscholen binnen het basisonderwijs. Een ingerichte FabLabbus kan op termijn een belangrijke rol gaan vervullen in de regio.\r\n\r\nSamen met HZ University of Applied Sciences, Dok 41, Scalda, Stichting ZigZag, Provincie Zeeland en Protospace Utrecht wordt onderzocht of er op termijn een groter FabLab op de kenniswerf in Vlissingen gevestigd kan worden. \r\n\r\nMeer weten?\r\nWil je meer informatie over FabLab Zeeland?

The Apple Valley High School Fab Lab is designed to support the school mission, providing opportunities for students and adults to solve real world problems through imagination, innovation, collaboration and technology.  \r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab is positioned in the school close to our full wood and metal shops, art rooms, and FACS (Family and Consumer Science) rooms, allowing for imagination and innovation in multiple mediums.  We are not limited, then, to just the fabrication lab but can instead combine multiple ways to create and innovate. AVHS students designed the Fab Lab layout itself and much of the furniture was designed and manufactured by students. We have a presentation system, which can wirelessly connect to all student laptops, allowing for student presentations. There are also 6 wall monitors that can connect to laptops in order to share work collaboratively with small groups.  \r\n\r\nThe FabLab space is available for teacher, classroom, and community use. Community education classes are being offered as well as various school age summer camps. The lab is financially and conceptually supported by 15 different local businesses. \r\n\r\nAVHS offers a program called E3 STEM, a grant supported by the Department of Labor and Department of Education.  This grant, in partnership with Dakota Technical College and Inver Hills Community college, provides programming opportunities for students 9-14 to explore, educate, and become employed in local and national business fields where employment rates are high.

Francesco Bombardi (*) who, after getting into contact with Fab Lab Amsterdam and many professionals working in other laboratories (Enrico Bassi Fab Lab Torino, Massimo Menichinelli Aalto Factory), decided to replicate the same experience in Reggio Emilia. After several consultations, the project was first presented to a number of possible promoters such as Reggio Emilia Innovation (REI), the Province of Reggio Emilia and the City Council, before being approved by the Board of Directors in July 2012. The settlement on the premises of Spazio Gerra (made available by Reggio Emilia City Council) took place in September 2012, while the official opening was held on October 27 of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab Reggio Emilia's mission is twofold: on one hand to support the companies in the paths of innovation and development of new ideas and projects through the development of people and interdisciplinary skills.\r\nThe Fab Lab launched  the  IDEA CHALLENGE formula, preparing a detailed brief with the company and guiding work groups (interdisciplinary)  to realize prototypes in one-two days time, using digital fabrication tools and know-how.\r\nProducts realized : 12 V Coffe Machine ( with Redox) , New Products in Polistirolo Espanso ( with CoopBox ), Digital Garden Kit ( in progress with IREN Rinnovabili), stencil customization for painting  decoration indoor ( with Litokol), Gadgets for Fotografia Europea 2013, condom twitter display ( with Industree for Durex).\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab Reggio Emilia is connected with Universit\u00e0 di Modena e Reggio, Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi di Ingegneria where Francesco Bombardi is helding a course of Industrial Design rapid prototyping.\r\nOne of the project-ptrototype developed by the student has been presented to Ferrari in Maranello.\r\nAnother was presented during the BarCamper tour ( accelerometro for guitar)\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Fab Lab is choosing some topics to research as to be able to  internally produce prototypes and propose them to users , institutions or companies.\r\nProducts : 3D Printer adaptation (with Redox) , window dynamic display unit (with UnderDesign) , fab \u2013valigia for schools (with Chiara Ferraboschi and Officina Educativa), Paesaggi di Formaggio (with Parmigiano Reggiano)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to allow individuals and / or communities to access tools useful to learn, experiment, prototype and self-produce, contributing to the emergence of new entrepreneurial projects.\r\nWorkshops: 3d printing, 3d scanning, laser cutting, robotics, tangible diagrams, 3d modeling, interaction design, fashion design, jewelry, cnc milling.\r\nWorkshop for schools and dedicated workshops for architects and managers ( INARC, CNA Emilia Romagna, MUSE Trento)\r\n\r\nReggio Emilia Innovazione (REI) has studied the economic feasibility and has also directly funded the fab lab's activities. The City Council has provided the location in the heart of the city center, materializing the idea of an Urban Factory, in close contact with the citizens and city's cultural events thanks to Spazio Gerra managers.\r\n\r\nThe fab lab is powered by Reggio Emilia Innovazione and managed and directed by Francesco Bombardi,  with the collaboration of Fernando Arias Sandoval.\r\nSeveral public and private actors have shared the fab lab's mission and took part in the project directly contributing for its realization.

We have been helped by Francesco Bombardi and Fernando Arias of the Fablab Reggio-Emilia, Andrea Danielli of Make in Italy association and Massimo Menichinelli of Make in Italy CDB fundation Onlus. After visiting several Fablabs in Italy (Fablab Torino, Fablab Reggio-Emilia, MakeinBo) and done our homework of studying several fablab in Europe (Fablab Barcellona, Aalto Factory, etc) we decided that it was time to open a Fablab in Parma.\r\n\r\nON/OFF Fablab Parma is a brainchild of \"ON/OFF Officina di Coworking\" which is a innovative service of the office of the Mayor of Parma and it is managed by \"Gruppo Scuola\" in collaboration with the Association of Social Promotion ON/OFF.\r\n\r\nON/OFF is a three stages project divided in CO-MAKE-SELL: COWORKING - FABLAB - MAKER'S SHOP.\r\n\r\nThe Coworking opened its doors on the 23rd of November 2013with the main goal to promote an aggregation point of freelancers and Startups. Currently we have people from different sectors from webdesigners, software engineers, film makers, journalists, writers, illustrators, graphic designers, European funding researchers, app developer, etc.\r\nRecently On/off partner also with an incubator (Parma-in)for Start-ups.\r\n\r\nThe different skills has created an environment rich of creativity and sparked new business opportunity for the professionals working there.\r\n\r\nThe help of the local government of Parma has been essential to help the growing of the project, since they helped giving the use of the location were at the moment the Coworking if base and where the Fablab has a place to live. The Fablab is looking for a bigger place since we are growing in number of associated and in number of Tools at the disposal of the community.\r\n\r\nOn/Off is also a universe made of space for artist to expose their work, for designer to create their clothes to the several workshops we have done till now.\r\n\r\nWE are very weary and it is of paramount importance to educate for this we work together with local schools and showing the interesting world of the 3d Printing, or with coderdojo teaching the beauty of coding software to young kids.\r\nWe are doing several courses to introduce the 3D printing revolution open to everyone and we are in the process to work on a new calendar of workshops starting in September/October 2014.\r\n\r\nWe are part of the \"virtuous network\" it's a network of organization who manage to be in continuos connection with the local people, being self-sustainable and create a link between the people and the territory where they live.\r\n\r\nThe coworkers and fabbers give back to the community as volunteer on several social projects, this is part of the mission we agree when we enter in ON/OFF Coworiking and Fablab and this is the reason the price of admission to use the services is lower than other places, because we give back to the community of Parma.\r\n\r\n At the moment we fulfilled only two stages of the project: the Coworking and the Fablab. At the moment we are working on the next phase, thus the Maker's shop, where the digital manufacturing artisan and artist will have a physical place where to sell their creations and where the services of the Coworking and the Fablab will be offered to the local community.\r\n\r\n We are young in respect of other Fablab but we are very lucky since we have a great community with amazing competences.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we are working on implementing a robotic hand within the Fablab and We aim with one of the group to research and produce a low cost prosthesis arm and hand and tools for disabled people.\r\n\r\nWe are working on an original 3D Printer the Coobot of one of our group 3DPR.\r\n\r\nWe are working on how to create objects with 3D printers to help Blind people in the museum to recognize and touch a smaller version of a statue for example, this is done by the 3D ArcheoLab group.\r\n\r\nWe have already partecipated and show our project during:\r\n- Torino Mini Maker Faire;\r\n- Rome Maker Faire;\r\n- New York Maker Faire;\r\n- 3D Print Hub profesional faire in Parma (Mecspe) and in Bologna (Exposanit\u00e0);\r\n- R2B part of Smau in Bologna;\r\n- FAB10 Barcellona.\r\n\r\nIn the Fablab we have the following groups:\r\n- Biohacking in collaboration with Fabiana Ciciriello;\r\n- Fablab kids (for kids from 4 to 14 years old) with Michela Grasselli and \"Le quattro Mani\";\r\n- Heritage Lab in collaboration with 3D ARCHEOLAB and Giulio Bigliardi;\r\n- Wearable and Fashion technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast but not least we are part of Mak-ER the regional network of Fablabs of the Region Emilia Romagna.

In addition, the Trust offers a wide range of technological and educational projects to anyone and everyone in Poland.\r\n \r\nFor our workshop and projects we have a large group of makers, engineers and experts in many areas, including but not limited to: digital CNC, 3D printing, electronics, material science and artistic creativity. We work together to make and create both with technology and for the whole community. Thanks to the open exchange of information in many areas, we have created an environment which makes it possible to complete almost any project, whether CNC tools, specialist educational workshops, artistic constructions or something else.\r\n \r\nIt turns out that providing easy access to professional tools and people with the required practical knowledge fills a very important need locally. Access to tools and knowledge also makes it possible for young makers and constructors to learn the technical and practical skills which they need. We try hard to actively fill in the gaps in education when it comes to technical areas, as well as to actively encourage young people to think up and make their own projects, to make what they want to make.\"\r\n\r\nVirtual tour available on <a href=\"http://www.lodz360.com/fablab/\">fablab 360</a>", "phone": "+48600815819", "header_image_src": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/QbCyOMg2Q6693DWgMyFb", "slug": "fablablodz", "name": "FabLab \u0141\u00f3d\u017a", "url": "https://www.fablabs.io/fablablodz", "longitude": 19.5018995, "address_1": "Pi\u0142sudskiego 135", "address_2": "", "address_notes": "Al.

This would promote a really positive, meaningful experience giving kids somewhere to go that they can do their homework in the company of highly educated and kind role models.  Their school work will improve and so will their aspirations because of the conversations they will have with informed and well connected people.  \r\n\r\nWhy Should the Coventry Universities invest in Cov Fab Lab?\r\n\u2022\tThe Fab Lab network opens up opportunities for REF-able outputs and pathways to impact. Research in fab labs includes for example, social relations, citizen science, education, small and middle-sized businesses and health care. The common denominator in the research is digital fabrication; \r\n\u2022\tMany local people feel that Coventry University in particular is taking over their city centre and that it is not for them.  A Cov Fab Lab in the city centre would promote and support the opening up of the City\u2019s University education, research and facilities to local people;\r\n\u2022\tThe Fab Lab will enrich the student experience by supporting placements and UG & PG projects in partnership with local organisations, people and businesses. \r\n\r\nCov Fab Lab Champions (Committed to realising the Cov Fab Lab through bid writing, developing associated research outputs, volunteering, supporting Fab Lab Student placement projects etc.). \r\nCoventry University\r\n\u2022\tProfessor Mike Hardy, Director (CTPSR)\r\n\u2022\tSinead Ouillon, Programme Leader the City University Initiative (CTPSR)\r\n\u2022\tDr E.

The Labs are affiliated to the International School of Design and Architecture of the University of Turabo and the International Design Center in Puerto Rico. The distance between each lab is fairly close and accessible to any member or user. The FabLab Puerto Rico has four basic functions;\r\n\r\n1.\tSchool's formal lab and more -- FabLab Puerto Rico is the International School of Design and Architecture Lab. We work with our design students in Fashion, Industrial, Interior, Graphic Design and Architecture. We collaborate with artists and designers from all communities in Puerto Rico to promote experimentation and innovation.\r\n\r\n2.\tOpen FabLab -- We have an active collaborative program with educational and community-based projects and institutions working with them at no charge. We are working with public museums, preservation institutions; community based initiatives, schools and cultural preservation projects. It\u2019s a constant initiative that extends the use of the lab facility as we use the school students, professors and volunteers. A short proposal is required.\r\n\r\n3.\tPrototyping and R&D for the IDC -- The International Design Center promotes design development and innovation for all local industries. We offer a variety of design services like web page and product development, graphic design, packaging and prototyping. The IDC project was created at the University of Turabo with public and private funds. FabLab Puerto Rico is the tool that takes care of the fabrication and R&D services provided for small and medium business. We work with inventors, designers and commercial institutions. This commercial side of the operation of the Lab hires students and professors to promote hands on experiences with the reality of our industry.\r\n\r\n4.\tEducation -- Open to any student from any educational institutions in Puerto Rico. Fee based $30.00/ hour (on digital equipment only). Must be an academic project. FabLab PR organizes a series of free seminars for the general public on digital fabrication and traditional fabrication techniques.\r\n\r\nFabLab Puerto Rico was conceived to be a formal FabLab, and has available the equipment and the commitment to collaborate with community-based initiatives as well as design and creative industries. \r\nThe Lab is offering free access for collaborations in an effort to have open access to the general public. \r\n\r\nThe Caribbean is a new frontier and we want to share the FabLab network and its power to share and transform to the rest of our neighbors. We are makers, love to help, collaborate, experiment, teach and learn. \r\n\r\nWelcome to FabLab Puerto Rico\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\nDean, International school of Design and Architecture / Director, International Design Center\r\nAurorisa Mateo\r\n\r\nDirector of Laboratories ISDA / FabLab Puerto Rico\r\nCarlos I.

In China, Fab Lab Wuhan has another name called \u201cThe Micro-Innovation Lab of the Optical valley\u201d which proved the big influence from it to the local innovation needs. From the beginning of this lab, we have set up the goal to achieve:  build up a service system to help the innovators and makers during the whole process from inspiration to Prototype, deploy the concept, knowledge and skills of digital manufacturing, make innovation easier to more people. \r\n\r\nFor Innovation Service:  Now, Fab Lab Wuhan is a real agglomeration of intelligent equipment, networking, field of set Exchange, sharing, practice, testing and commercial operation. We also cooperate with local angel investment to help students optimize their production for commercial purpose. The total area of Fab Lab Wuhan is more than 400 square meter, half of the space is for equipment, including a GCC laser cutter, 3D printer, Rolland SRM-20 CNC, vinyl cutter, CNC milling machine, 3D scanner etc. The other half is the workshop space. The lab is fully open to the public. We provide free basic material for testing purpose. In every Saturday, there will be a salon or lecture of ideas collision and learning. Normally the topic is no limited, technical, trend analysis, commercial and any others. The speaker is mainly someone who has expertise and skills to share. So far we have 14 innovation teams working in our lab.\r\n\r\nFor Research:  Fab lab Wuhan works with professors from school of mechanical engineering, electronic and Materials science, etc. The on-going project include: Upgrading the desktop level 3D printer to the industrial-grade 3D printer for lab use with professor Li from school of mechanical engineering and developing a glass cleaning robot with a local company. Fab lab also plays the role as the second innovation center for local companies. Now we have set up the fab research center in HUST Qiming College, working on the fab 2.0 solution to make some new machines based on the local lab and company\u2019s needs. \r\nFor Education: Supported by the HUST, Fab lab Wuhan is working on how to deploy the concept of digital manufacturing to more students in university. We already participate the fab academy in 2016 and then deploy the fab related courses in local school. We also deploy the stem education methods through the fab lab system in local middle and high school, introducing to teenagers of maker space, maker movement concept.\r\n\r\nBase on the support of HUST and Optical Valley, Fab Lab Wuhan has got a big platform to deploy innovation in different way.

This Fab Lab is a prototype for other early childhood Fab Labs to learn from and replicate. The goals of the early childhood Fab Lab include providing quality STEM experiences that empower children as thinkers and problem solvers, invite children to imagine, test, and refine solutions to improve the world, foster curiosity, persistence, and deep understanding, promote shared learning between children and adults, and produce deep content outcomes. Children, their families, and teachers will access the Fab Lab primarily through workshops (ranging from 45 minutes to 2 hours). During the week, these workshops will be offered to preschools and elementary schools as facilitated field trips. On the weekends, they will be offered to families as part of our public programs.

Seja bem vindo, o prazer \u00e9 todo nosso. \r\n\r\nO Fab Lab Recife \u00e9 para makers, curiosos e empreendedores de todas as \u00e1reas. Uma boa ideia pode vir de qualquer pessoa, ainda que sem conhecimento sobre fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o digital. E como um de nossos prop\u00f3sitos \u00e9 promover a forma\u00e7\u00e3o e dar autonomia para que voc\u00ea crie suas pr\u00f3prias coisas, oferecemos, todos os meses, workshops b\u00e1sicos.

E podemos muito.\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\nAs in a first meeting let us introduce ourselves: we are the Fab Lab Recife. If you have already heard of us, stay awhile and get to know us better; if you haven\u2019t, this is a great opportunity to do so. Welcome, it\u2019s our pleasure.\r\n\r\nFab Lab Recife is a place for makers, curious and entrepreneurs from all fields. A good idea can come from anyone and they don\u2019t necessarily have to know about digital manufacturing. That\u2019s why one of our purposes is to promote training and empower people to create their own things, by offering every month basic workshops. We have also membership plans, tasting visits and a day for free use of the lab (Open Day).\r\n\r\nKids and teenagers have a special place at Fab Lab Recife. We want to bring to light the inventiveness that we all have in childhood and it\u2019s suppressed over the years as we grow old. We want them to loosen their creativity and also that the adults recover their own. Creation is always a playful process, even when it\u2019s intended for very specific purposes. The creative economy and the ability to innovate continuously are the key to our social, economic and environmental issues.

We enable makers of all kinds to imagine, design and create using open source software and DIY equipment. We do this by working with a local and international network to actively cultivate public engagement through community-focused art, entrepreneurship, research and education.\r\n\r\nPhysically, our Fab Lab is an advanced workshop space for rapid prototyping and computer-based design.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a suite of fabrication machines, including a laser engraver, CNC routers, 3D printers and scanners, electronic cutters, digital textile machines, small board electronics, graphic drawing tablets, advanced software and more. We collaborate with several grant projects and community partners locally to provide similar tools at a variety of other locations, including public libraries and after-school centers.\r\n\r\nCulturally, the CUC Fab Lab is driven by a community of practice, people often referred to as Makers.\r\n\r\nOpen-Source Movement Makers like us are are united by the desire to share knowledge, collaborate and to \u201cmake almost anything.\u201d Our lab is open to the public, employs both staff and volunteers and greatly values both diversity and play, as we believe these are necessary for innovation. Our network and patrons include people of all kinds: students, teens, families, entrepreneurs, artists, hobbyists, gamers, hackers, engineers, scientists, teachers, librarians, activists and more. We welcome those interested to join the conversation and discover more about who we are!\r\n\r\nFunctionally, Fab Labs encourage people to become makers by exploring the entire design process.\r\n\r\nThey do this by providing tools, human assistance and inspiration that enable people to go from (1) concepts and questions to (2) digital designs and models to (3) physical prototypes and redesigns to (4) a final product they can share, which may in turn help others begin the cycle. This process is rather unique because it is possible for people with little technological expertise to engage in design thinking to develop complex creations using technology and knowledge previously only available to expert artists and engineers. Our lab specializes in working with individuals, groups and organizations to provide makerspace curriculum and related programming.\r\n\r\nOrganizationally, our Fab Lab is a public engagement program of the Illinois Informatics Institute.\r\n\r\nWe work with a variety of units, including The Graduate School of Library and Information Science, Department of Business Administration, School of Art and Design and Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences to collaborate on grants, facilitate classes and support research. Although many places might be referred to as a fab lab, our Fab Lab is part of the global network connected to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Bits and Atoms. This collaborative network connects institutions around the world with common tools, software platforms and ideologies to facilitate the open exchange of ideas and designs.\r\n\r\nPhilosophically, we believe the open source ethos of the Fab Lab inspires interest and innovation in many fields.\r\n\r\nWe strive to connect computer-based making and rapid fabrication to many areas, like art and design, computer science, architecture, engineering, mathematics, science, and technical trades. We think community access, provided at a reasonable cost and in cooperation with the global Fab Lab network, builds local capacities by enabling personal growth, economic development and cross-cultural understanding. Activities at the Fab Lab and our partner sites embody the principle of life-long learning by cultivating digital literacies, including cognitive skills like computational, divergent or critical thinking, but also related cultural competencies and other underlying traits that prove fundamental to holistic learning, such as civic engagement or confidence with art and technology.", "phone": "(217) 300-1639", "header_image_src": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/BLoZHsykSGqIfqZJm99e", "slug": "cucommunityfablab", "name": "Champaign-Urbana Community Fab Lab", "url": "https://www.fablabs.io/cucommunityfablab", "longitude": -88.2247705, "address_1": "1301 S Goodwin Ave", "address_2": "Art Annex 2", "address_notes": "It's across the street from the ACES library (the octagon-shaped building)"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [23.3749676, 72.6950033000001]}, "type": "Fab Lab", "properties": {"links": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/fablabnifindia", "id": 1355}], "county": "Gujarat", "postal_code": "382721", "country_code": "in", "id": 37, "kind_name": "fab_lab", "city": "Gandhinagar", "capabilities": ["three_d_printing", "cnc_milling", "laser", "vinyl_cutting"], "parent_id": null, "latitude": 23.3749676, "email": "abhinavj@nifindia.org", "blurb": "NIF's Fab Lab is a facility being used to develop grassroots innovations and support grassroots innovators.", "avatar": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/e6KTsWJCQ1yt2zRoEiw3", "description": "NIF's Fab Lab is an inclusive, supportive facility for the development of grassroots innovations.

Most of the hardware featured in these work spaces are easily controlled by user friendly software programs installed on desktop computers no different than the ones we use at work or home. The intent of the Fab Lab is to put this sophisticated machinery in the hands of students as young as middle school exposing them to engineering and design by giving them the opportunity to turn ideas into tangible products.\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab concept began as an outreach program at MIT that aimed to promote creativity and innovation among students. By giving students the necessary tools and fostering an environment where imagination to invent and create was encouraged, Fab Labs quickly gained popularity with fab labs now being created in opened in rural India, northern Norway, Afghanistan, Ghana, Boston and Costa Rica. Users are finding that students who are able to apply design and engineering concepts toward the creation of real things are able to learn much more than they could through just exams or textbooks.\r\n\r\nThis has definitely been the case at CITC\u2019s fab lab, where Alaskan Native students are discovering the sky\u2019s the limit when working within a supportive community with access to the right tools. With some basic instruction and training provided by an on-site adviser, students who often struggle in a traditional educational environment are now running many of the standard machines in the Fab Lab \u2013 3D printers, laser and vinyl cutters \u2013 to create a wide range of products made from wood, metal and plastic. This type of hands-on learning experience exposes the students to a wide range of design, engineering and architectural concepts in a fun, holistic way that cannot be achieved in the classroom. \r\n\r\nWhen students transform a simple idea into a tangible finished product, they get an overwhelming sense of accomplishment \u2013 not to mention a lot of handy products. Some of the student-created items proudly on display in the workshop include decorative wool scarves, a Spanish-style classical guitar, personalized paper stationary, and even spare automotive parts. During the holidays, students took advantage of the workshops to create Christmas ornaments and custom silk-screen t-shirts that were given as gifts to family and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil recently, it wasn\u2019t feasible for small operations to access this type of cutting-edge technology. CITC understands this opportunity at hand and is working toward developing multiple fab lab programs, both for youth and adults that will continue to connect people with technology through education. \r\n", "phone": "907-793-3630", "header_image_src": "", "slug": "citcfablab", "name": "CITC FabLab", "url": "https://www.fablabs.io/citcfablab", "longitude": -149.810683623279, "address_1": "3600 San Jeronimo Ct", "address_2": "", "address_notes": ""}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [44.0485301, -123.094962]}, "type": "Fab Lab", "properties": {"links": [{"url": "http://eugene.libguides.com/maker/3D-printing-and-fabrication", "id": 2085}, {"url": "https://www.eugene-or.gov/3276/Make-It", "id": 2084}], "county": "OR", "postal_code": "97401", "country_code": "us", "id": 1179, "kind_name": "fab_lab", "city": "Eugene", "capabilities": ["three_d_printing", "cnc_milling", "vinyl_cutting"], "parent_id": null, "latitude": 44.0485301, "email": "makerhub@ci.eugene.or.us", "blurb": "Eugene Public Library's maker activities offer a wide variety of ways to develop skills, use tools, explore, invent, and create for success in school, work, art, and life.", "avatar": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/kVTbkoRR1GaZk2VLzfCb", "description": "The Eugene Public Library's Maker Hub has three avenues of access for anyone with a library card.

It continues LimeWharf\u2019s experimental approach hybridising different known formats. There will be three different parts to the Machines Room: the Makerspace, where anyone, on a membership basis, can come and use the machinery, with demonstrations from resident makers; the Academy, where people can learn new technologies & skills; and an Incubator/Accelerator, where entrepreneurs can bring ideas to life.\r\n\r\nThis addition to the already vibrant Cultural Innovation Hub which has a cafe, galleries, co-working spaces, artists and technologists in residence (Clear Village, TWSU and more), is a way to amplify the possibilities of creation onsite as well as inspiring locals of all generations that may not naturally go to a hackspace to learn about this emerging reality.\r\n\r\nThe Machines Room\u2019s features include a laser cutter, vinyl cutter, Roland CNC, 3D printer, an electronics bench, a tool bench and sewing/embroidery machinery and an assortment of other kit invaluable to designers, artists, textile specialists and other product makers. The \u2018Machines Room\u2019 will fit in with the fabrication ecosystem in East London and be connected to the Fab Lab network as well as hosting a Maker Library in conjunction with the British Council.\r\n\r\nThe long term ambition of the initiative is to give prosumers a serious play environment that can inspire socially impactful solutions for places in need, particularly within the developing world. Promoting an ethos of self-reliance whilst also providing a platform for entrepreneurs and people who want to make change through affordable innovation, the \u2018Machines Room\u2019 connects the dots between tech, enterprise and the arts.\r\n\r\nLimeWharf\u2019s founder, architect and curator, Thomas Ermacora, is a creative director and social entrepreneur, who wants to make the initiative an open-door \u2018ecosystem\u2019 for cultural innovation bringing together dynamics to the benefit of the surrounding area. \u2018There is a dreamer in all of us that can intuitively imagine the consequence of exponential technology developments today on the future of everything around us.
